# Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project
This data set is a summary of the original data files from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset".  The summary data set represents the mean value of each measurement for each activity and subject.  The variables are defined as follows:
## Activity
The activity the subject was engaged in when the measurments were taken.  The six activities are:  "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", & "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
## Subject
The subject number of the 30 subjects in the test study.
##[t/f]BodyAcc-mean()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the mean Body Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
##[t/f]BodyAcc-std()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the standard deviation of the Body Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
##[t/f]GravityAcc-mean()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the mean Gravity Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
##[t/f]GravityAcc-std()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the standard deviation of the Gravity Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
##[t/f]BodyAccJerk-mean()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the mean Body Jerk Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
##[t/f]BodyAccJerk-std()-[X/Y/Z]
The average of the standard deviation of the Body Jerk Acceleration during the activity by the subject.  Measurements are given in the time[t] and frequency[f] domains for the three axis [X/Y/Z].
